## dashbase-config-template
A template to make a configuration directory for a Dashbase deployment. Start with this configuration and customize for your needs.

## Background
Dashbase is comprised of a set of services: API, Table, Web, etc. controlled from Dashbase CLI. The configuration for each service exists in its own directory, which you will find here in the configuration template. The dashbase.yml file describes the overall deployment, refers to the configurations for each service, and contains connection info and mapping of machines to the services that should be installed on each.
